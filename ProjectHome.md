MPlayer is a free and open source media player. MPlayer supports a wide variety of media formats, including DVD and (unencrypted) Blu-ray. Best of all, it's free.

<h2>Download</h2>
The latest version is featured under "Downloads". My MPlayer builds and source code are packed using <a href='http://www.7-zip.org'>7-Zip</a> and can be extracted using any archiving program compatible with the 7-Zip format. There is no installer, extract anywhere you like and either run directly from a command prompt or configure a GUI frontend such as <a href='http://smplayer.sourceforge.net'>SMPlayer</a> to use it.<br>
<br>
SMPlayer is a free and open source GUI for MPlayer featuring a configurable, skinnable and easy to use interface with features such as remembering your position in a video, localization, subtitle search, and YouTubeâ„¢ video search and playback.<br>
<br>
If you need an older release, use the "All downloads" Search in the Downloads sections to show all previous and current versions.<br>

<h2>About</h2>
I try to keep my binaries and sources close to the MPlayer upstream source as much as possible. While other builds may include tons of added functionality, this may come at the price of stability. I aim to provide stability above functionality because untested features may bring about unexpected behavior and crashes, and functionality is useless if crashes result.<br>
<br>
<h2>Support</h2>
These builds are maintained independently by me and not The MPlayer Project, however, feel free to open a new issue on the Issues pages if you encounter any bugs or the <a href='http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/mailing_lists.html'>MPlayer mailing lists</a>. For usage help, refer to the manual included in each release.
